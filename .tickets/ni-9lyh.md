# Review evidence for multi-agent team setups

- Collect and synthesize peer-reviewed papers, technical reports, and benchmark studies on multi-agent/swarm/team LLM systems.
- Focus on measurable outcomes vs strong single-agent baselines: quality, reliability, cost, latency, and robustness.
- Capture where evidence is weak, mixed, or negative.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Source list with citations and publication venue for every major claim.
- Evidence matrix: setup, task type, baseline, metrics, and result direction/magnitude.
- Section for limitations, threats to validity, and negative results.
