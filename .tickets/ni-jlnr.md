# Plan orchestration skill adaptation and evaluation rollout

- Translate proposed architecture into concrete changes to your orchestration skill.
- Define phased rollout from one-shot tickets to multi-agent coordination workflows.
- Specify evaluation protocol and success thresholds before broader adoption.

## Acceptance Criteria

- List concrete orchestration skill changes (prompts, routing logic, state handling, retries).
- A/B evaluation plan against current workflow with clear metrics and sample size guidance.
- Follow-up implementation tickets created and sequenced.
