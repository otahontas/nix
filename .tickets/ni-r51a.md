# Document orchestration requirements for plan mode

Capture current orchestration flow, decision points, and constraints so plan mode requirements are explicit.

## Acceptance Criteria

- List current orchestration steps and where planning support is needed.
- Define must-have vs nice-to-have plan mode capabilities.
- Identify constraints (UX, prompts, tooling, and multi-agent behavior).
