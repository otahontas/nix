# Design target agent-team architecture for your workflow

- Propose a practical team architecture for your day-to-day ticket workflow.
- Define agent roles (planner, implementer, reviewer, verifier, etc.), communication protocol, and handoff contract.
- Specify stopping criteria, escalation paths, and quality gates.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Architecture diagram/description with role responsibilities and interfaces.
- Prompt/protocol templates for each role and handoff payload schema.
- Tradeoff analysis: expected gains, cost/latency overhead, and failure modes.
