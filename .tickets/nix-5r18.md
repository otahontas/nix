# Update orchestrate skill with complexity routing and prompt templates

Update orchestrate/SKILL.md with 3-level complexity routing (simple/medium/hard) and prescriptive prompt templates for each role. See docs/ni-jlnr-orchestration-adaptation-plan.md section 2.1-2.2 and docs/ni-yrf9-agent-team-architecture.md section 2.

## Acceptance Criteria

- SKILL.md includes classification criteria (simple: <3 files, medium: 4-10 files, hard: >10 files)
- Simple tasks: do it yourself path documented
- Medium tasks: single agent with self-review path
- Hard tasks: full multi-agent workflow
- Updated prompt templates for planner, implementer, reviewer roles
