# Investigate forcing pi agent to run pre-commits after each file edit

Investigate how to configure pi agent hooks so that pre-commit checks run automatically after each file edit. Devenv already supports defining Claude Code hooks — check if those can be leveraged for pi as well, or used as inspiration for a pi-specific solution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Document whether pi supports post-edit hooks
- If possible, provide a working configuration
- If not possible, document limitations and alternatives
