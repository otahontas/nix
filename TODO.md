- nushell extraenv splitted to multiple and put to correct places
- nushell llm to separate file
- acp cleanup: much simpler setup (not so much defaults and other shit from zsh version)
- acp autocompletion: all the profiles
- better aws config generation (maybe just directly from pass)
- skhd better combo (the setup is a bit messy atm)
- xdg config wherever possible
- test that docker login through pass works
- test that npm login through pass works
- replace 1password ssh with gpg signing. But make sure that all the commits are still properly verified.
- gpg touchid setup
- replace 1password setups everywhere, leave 1password to be just an application
- in general don't allow claude or copilot to access tokens / env files / secret files, I hate it when those do
- remember to rotate keys often (how? some sort of check)
- add claude files to nix
