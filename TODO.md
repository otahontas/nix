# TODO

- Proper Skim setup to replace fzf (nushell integration too)
- port rest of the zsh
- proper minimal .zshrc and and .bashrc to reduce cluttering home folder
- nix + password store setup for passwords
- custom keyboard layout + installing it
- safe-chain aikido setup
- .aws audit
- 1password cli -> trash
- Docker audit WARNING! Your credentials are stored unencrypted in '/Users/otahontas/.docker/config.json'. Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See https://docs.docker.com/go/credential-store/
- better "make command X work" -> press something -> llm provides the correct cmd type of workflow
