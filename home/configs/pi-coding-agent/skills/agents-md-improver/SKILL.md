# AGENTS.md Improver

Audit, evaluate, and improve AGENTS.md files across a codebase to ensure Pi has optimal project context.

**This skill can write to AGENTS.md files.** After presenting a quality report and getting user approval, it updates AGENTS.md files with targeted improvements.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

Find all AGENTS.md files in the repository:

```bash
find . -name "AGENTS.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**File Types & Locations:**

| Type             | Location                 | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project root     | `./AGENTS.md`            | Primary project context (checked into git, shared with team) |
| Global defaults  | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`  | User-wide defaults across all projects                       |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/AGENTS.md` | Module-level context in monorepos                            |
| Subdirectory     | Any nested location      | Feature/domain-specific context                              |

**Note:** Pi auto-discovers AGENTS.md files in parent directories, making monorepo setups work automatically.

### Phase 2: Quality Assessment

For each AGENTS.md file, evaluate against quality criteria. See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for detailed rubrics.

**Quick Assessment Checklist:**

| Criterion                     | Weight | Check                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Commands/workflows documented | High   | Are build/test/deploy commands present?   |
| Architecture clarity          | High   | Can Pi understand the codebase structure? |
| Non-obvious patterns          | Medium | Are gotchas and quirks documented?        |
| Conciseness                   | Medium | No verbose explanations or obvious info?  |
| Currency                      | High   | Does it reflect current codebase state?   |
| Actionability                 | High   | Are instructions executable, not vague?   |

**Quality Scores:**

- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable
- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections
- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated
- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely outdated

### Phase 3: Quality Report Output

**ALWAYS output the quality report BEFORE making any updates.**

Format:

```
## AGENTS.md Quality Report

### Summary
- Files found: X
- Average score: X/100
- Files needing update: X

### File-by-File Assessment

#### 1. ./AGENTS.md (Project Root)
**Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Commands/workflows | X/20 | ... |
| Architecture clarity | X/20 | ... |
| Non-obvious patterns | X/15 | ... |
| Conciseness | X/15 | ... |
| Currency | X/15 | ... |
| Actionability | X/15 | ... |

**Issues:**
- [List specific problems]

**Recommended additions:**
- [List what should be added]

#### 2. ./packages/api/AGENTS.md (Package-specific)
...
```

### Phase 4: Targeted Updates

After outputting the quality report, ask user for confirmation before updating.

**Update Guidelines (Critical):**

1. **Propose targeted additions only** - Focus on genuinely useful info:
   - Commands or workflows discovered during analysis
   - Gotchas or non-obvious patterns found in code
   - Package relationships that weren't clear
   - Testing approaches that work
   - Configuration quirks

2. **Keep it minimal** - Avoid:
   - Restating what's obvious from the code
   - Generic best practices already covered
   - One-off fixes unlikely to recur
   - Verbose explanations when a one-liner suffices

3. **Show diffs** - For each change, show:
   - Which AGENTS.md file to update
   - The specific addition (as a diff or quoted block)
   - Brief explanation of why this helps future sessions

**Diff Format:**

`````markdown
### Update: ./AGENTS.md

**Why:** Build command was missing, causing confusion about how to run the project.

````diff
+ ## Quick Start
+
+ ```bash
+ npm install
+ npm run dev  # Start development server on port 3000
+ ```
````
`````

````

```

### Phase 5: Apply Updates

After user approval, apply changes using the Edit tool. Preserve existing content structure.

## Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for AGENTS.md templates by project type.

## Common Issues to Flag

1. **Stale commands**: Build commands that no longer work
2. **Missing dependencies**: Required tools not mentioned
3. **Outdated architecture**: File structure that's changed
4. **Missing environment setup**: Required env vars or config
5. **Broken test commands**: Test scripts that have changed
6. **Undocumented gotchas**: Non-obvious patterns not captured

## User Tips to Share

When presenting recommendations, remind users:

- **Keep it concise**: AGENTS.md should be human-readable; dense is better than verbose
- **Actionable commands**: All documented commands should be copy-paste ready
- **Global defaults**: Put user-wide preferences in `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`

## What Makes a Great AGENTS.md

**Key principles:**
- Concise and human-readable
- Actionable commands that can be copy-pasted
- Project-specific patterns, not generic advice
- Non-obvious gotchas and warnings

**Recommended sections** (use only what's relevant):
- Commands (build, test, dev, lint)
- Architecture (directory structure)
- Key Files (entry points, config)
- Code Style (project conventions)
- Environment (required vars, setup)
- Testing (commands, patterns)
- Gotchas (quirks, common mistakes)
- Workflow (when to do what)
```
